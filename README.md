A dead-simple html5 Responsive Boilerplate than shines on IE6 too.

I've played with a lot of boilerplates/html5 frameworks till today.
Each single framework ( like bootstrap, Foundation, ... ) have failed somehow to provide a consistent tool for my web devs.
Some don't even support IE7, their majority is bulky and very determinist on the visual aspect.
They are tools to make xeroxed, standard-looking website.
Trying to bend them toward what you want requires to almost double the code size as you have to overload each element css definitions.
Often adding a simple border will result in blocks to collapse, back to css overriding ;/
Html5 is in so much hype those days, you have to constantly monitor your components no to bulk it all.
Finally, who needs a grid system if you're not crafting a mag?

So I made my own pack of cross-browser files: 
- a fixed-size container
- rows to put content in
- 1,2,3,4 or 5 blocks per row
- borders included ( turn them to background color to make them disappear), they won't collapse your layout anymore.
- 3 breakpoints: 0, 480, 950px
- IE6/7/8 backward compatibility

This Boilerplate embeds other github project:

- html5 boileplate ( stripped to bones )
- respond.js
- modernizer.js ( thus html5shiv )
- normalize.css
- Some love.

And yeah, you can do better/slimmer/etc...
And yeah, code isn't optimal, but that's a dragon quest, sir!
